This is a Restful php api that works with MongoDb 

A Controller is an endpoint like : Yoursite/Users ====> Users is a Controller

Each controller can have unlimited popo as it's children , so for example if we want to show a functionality in our Users endpoint , 
we can create a popo like : signup 
and the urls becomes : Yoursite/Users/signup
Each popo ( Plain Old Php Object) is a class that is related to a Controller
